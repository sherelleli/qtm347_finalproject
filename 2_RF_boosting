    "In this section, we will use tree-based models, namely Random Forest and XGboost, to predict student test performance (G3). We will start with all predictors and then present a table showing the importance ranking. In the linear regression analysis, we treated student performance as a continuous variable. But since tree-based models are better-suited for categorical variables, we will create a categorical performance variable from the original variable G3.\n",
