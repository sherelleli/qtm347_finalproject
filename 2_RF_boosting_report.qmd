## 3 Methodology
### 3.2 Random Forest
After using linear regression to predict student grade as a continuous variable, we used random forest to classify their letter grade (A, B, C, etc.,) and performance (high-performing and low-performning). In Portugal, universities use a 0-20 scale grading system, which can be translated to the letter grade system used in the US as follows.

| Portugal Grade | US grade | 
| :--- | :---: |
| 18 - 20 | A+ |
| 16 - 17.9 | A |
| 14 - 15.9 | A- |
| 12 - 13.9 | B |
| 10 - 11.9 | C |
| 0 - 9.9 | F |

Then, we will classify students whose grade is A+, A, and A- as high-performing students while those whose grade is B, C, and F as low-performing students.

To give our readers a brief overview of the random forest algorithm, random forest is an extension of the decision tree algorithm. A decision tree splits the dataset based on a binary condition of the data points’ features recursively. For each split, among all possible conditions, the condition that decreases the variance of the dataset after split the most is selected. After a certain number of split or when the variance is under a desired threshold, the decision tree stops splitting. For any new data point, the prediction will be the mean of the datapoints that satisfy the same binary conditions of the decision tree.

A random forest algorithm creates multiple decision trees and aggregate the result of the trees to obtain the final result. It randomly selects a certain number of observations and a certain number of features or variables from the original dataset and then train a decision tree based on each selection. The aggregation of multiple decision trees based on randomly sampled data makes the model less sensitive to subtle changes in the training data.

After we trained the model, we will look at the top 20 important features the model used to classify student letter grade and performance. Also, we will present the confusion matrix and ROC curve to show where is the model failing at.

We trained this model in python using the sklearn package.

### 3.3 XGBoost
Random forest is a very basic tree-based machine learning algorithm and we do not expect it to perform very well. Therefore, we also used XGBoost, a more sophisticated tree-based algorithm, to classify the letter grade and performance of students.

To understand XGBoost, we must first understand gradient boosting. Gradient boosting is an extension of the decision tree algorithm. It creates multiple decision trees and aggregate the results to obtain the final result. But unlike random forest, every decision tree gradient boosting creates depends on the results of the previous tree. The learning process starts from simply taking the mean of the dependent variable in the training set. Then, the residual error for each observation is calculated and a new decision tree is built to split the data until a certain number of leaves, which is preset as a parameter, is created. As the number of leaves is restricted, if more than one value is on the same leave, the value on that leaf will be replaced with their mean.

The predictions of residuals obtained by a decision tree will be scaled by a factor between 0 to 1, named learning rate, to prevent the model from over-fitting to the training data. And the actual prediction of this new tree will be the prediction of the previous tree plus the product of learning rate and the predicted residuals from the new tree. Then, the new residual error is calculated and the same process is repeated until a certain number of decision trees, which is also a preset parameter, is created. The final result $\hat{Y}$ of gradient boosting is as follows:

$$
\hat{Y} = \bar{Y} + \gamma r_1 + \gamma r_2 + \cdots + \gamma r_n
$$

Where $\hat{Y}$ is the mean of training data, $r_i$ is the residual error predicted by each decision tree,
and $\gamma$ is the learning rate.

Now, we move on to XGBoost. XGBoost is an extension of the Gradient Boosting algorithm. Similar to Gradient Boosting, it creates multiple trees to predict the residual error made by the past prediction and aggregate them to produce the final result. The differences between the two algorithms are the condition of splitting data and create branches in the decision tree, the inclusion of a regularization parameter, and the inclusion of a pruning process.

In Gradient Boosting, the condition to split data at each node in the decision tree is the one that decreases the variance of the data the most after split. While in XGBoost, the condition is the one that increases the similarity score of the data the most after split. The algorithm stops splitting the data after a certain number of times, which is a preset parameter. The similarity score of a leaf is calculated as:

$$
\text{Similarity Score} = \frac{(\sum \text{Residual})^2}{\text{Number of Residuals} + \lambda}
$$

Where $\gamma$ is a preset regularization parameter, ranging from 0 to positive infinity, that prevents the model from overfitting to the training data. After the split, the condition that maximizes the increase in similarity score is chosen. This parameter is also included when calculating the prediction result of each leaf:

$$
\text{predicted residual} = \frac{\sum \text{residual}}{\text{number of residual} + \lambda}
$$

Before the algorithm move on to build the next tree, XGBoost has an additional step of pruning. Starting from the last leaf created in the decision tree, if the increase in similarity score is smaller than gamma, which is a preset parameter, that split will be pruned, or eliminated from the decision tree. The process continues to the second last leaf in the decision tree until the increase in similarity score of one leaf is larger than gamma.

Then, next tree is built based on the residual error of the prediction of this tree until a certain number of trees has been created. The final result is also calculated the same way as in Gradient Boosting: summing the base of prediction and all the products of predicted residuals and a learning rate.

After we trained the model, we will look at the top 20 important features the model used to classify student letter grade and performance. Also, we will present the confusion matrix and ROC curve to show where is the model failing at.

We trained this model in python using the xgboost package.

## 4 Results
### 4.2 Random Forest
#### 4.2.1 Predicting Student Letter Grade
![Top 20 Important Features in Predicting Letter Grade by RF](graphs/RF_lettergrade_importantfeatures.png){#fig-RF_L_IF width=75%}

As we can see in @fig-RF_L_IF, total alchohal consumption is the most important feature in predicting a student's letter grade. It is slightly more important than the number of classes failed in the past and significantly more important than any other features. This result strongly confirms our hypothesis that total alchohol consumption contributes well to the prediction of students' grade.

However, the test error rate of random forest is 0.6538, meaning the model predicted 65.38% of the data wrong in the test set. But note that we have 6 levels here (A+, A, A-, B, C, F), the error rate of random guessing is 0.8333. Therefore, although the test error rate is not very low, it is still much lower than random guessing, making our model meaningful in predicting student letter grade.

Now, we present the confusion matrix to see where is the model failing at. Note that 1 - 6 cooresponds to F - A+ respectively.

![Confusion Matrix in Predicting Letter Grade by RF](graphs/RF_lettergrade_confusionmatrix.png){#fig-RF_L_CM width=75%}

As we can see in @fig-RF_L_CM, the model made no prediction of A or A+ and only 5 predictions of A-. This is because the number of students scoring higher or equal to A- takes up only 33% of the test set. Thus, the random forest model learns that it can perform better by just making less or no prediction of A-, A, and A+. After realizing this, we modified the ocde to force the model to make predictions of A- to A+. But the resulting test error rate is even higher. Therefore, such bias might just be an inherent flaw in the algorithm of random forest.

Finally, we present the ROC curve for this model.

![ROC Curve in Predicting Letter Grade by RF](graphs/RF_lettergrade_ROC.png){#fig-RF_L_ROC width=75%}

As we can see in @fig-RF_L_ROC, the model performs the best when predicting F and A+ as their curves have the highest AUC score.

#### 4.2.2 Predicting Student Performance
![Top 20 Important Features in Predicting Performance by RF](graphs/RF_performance_importantfeatures.png){#fig-RF_P_IF width=75%}

As we can see in @fig-RF_P_IF, when predicting student performance (high or low), the most important feature is the education of the mother, which significantly outperformed all other predictors, followed by total alchohol consumption. The number of classes failed, which is the second important feature in predicting student letter grade, now ranks the fourth. Therefore, we can still conclude that total alchohol consumption is an important predictor of student performance.

The test error rate for this model is 0.3385, meaning that it predicted 33.85% of the data wrong in test set. Note that we canot compare this error rate with the previous one as the outcome variable here, the performance, is binary, making random guessing having a error rate of 50%. 

The test error rate is still pretty high. And we present the confusion matrix to see where is the model failing at. Note that 0 is for low performance and 1 is for high performance.

![Confusion Matrix in Predicting Performance by RF](graphs/RF_performance_confusionmatrix.png){#fig-RF_P_CM width=75%}

As we can see in @fig-RF_P_CM, we encountered the same problem as in 4.2.1. As there are fewer students with high performance, the model learns that it can perform better by making less prediction of high performance.

Finally, we present the ROC curve for this model.

![ROC Curve in Predicting Performance by RF](graphs/RF_performance_ROC.png){#fig-RF_P_ROC width=75%}

From @fig-RF_P_ROC, we can see that the ROC curve is moderately higher than the diagonal, meaning that the model is moderately better than random guessing, but still not very good at predicting performance.

### 4.3 XGBoost
#### 4.3.1 Predicting Student Letter Grade
![Top 20 Important Features in Predicting Letter Grade by XGBoost](graphs/xg_lettergrade_importantfeatures.png){#fig-XG_L_IF width=75%}

As shown in @fig-fig-XG_L_IF, among the top 20 most important features to predict student letter grade by XGBoost, total alchohol consumption ranks the fifth. The most important feature is the number of classes failed, which is also considered to be very important by random forest. We can conclude that according to XGBoost, total alchohol consumption is an important feature to predict student letter grade.

The test error rate for this model is 0.6769, meaning that the model predicted 67.69% of data wrong in the test set. Comparing to the test error rate of 0.6538 by random forest on the same problem, XGBoost does not exhibit much improvement in performance.

Now, we present the confusion matrix to see where is the model failing at.

![Confusion Matrix in Predicting Letter Grade by XGBoost](graphs/xg_lettergrade_confusionmatrix.png){#fig-XG_L_CM width=75%}

From @fig-XG_L_CM, we can see the same problem in @fig-RF_L_CM: the model learns that it can perform better by just making less or no prediction of A-, A, and A+. Since this problem is not unique to random forest, it might be a common flaw in tree-based algorithms.

![ROC curve in Predicting Letter Grade by XGBoost](graphs/xg_lettergrade_ROC.png){#fig-XG_L_ROC width=75%}

From @fig-XG_L_ROC, we can see that the model is best at predicting grade F, which is consistant with the confusion matrix.

#### 4.3.2 Predicting Student Performance
![Top 20 Important Features in Predicting Performance by XGBoost](graphs/xg_performance_importantfeatures.png){#fig-XG_P_IF width=75%}

From @fig-XG_P_IF, we can see that the number of classes failed significantly outranks all other features to be the most important one while total alchohol consumption ranks only the ninth. Considering there are a total of 38 features, ranking the ninth still implies total alchohol consumption to be fairly important in predicting student letter grade.

The test error rate is 0.2462, meaning that it predicted 24.62% of the data wrong in the test set. Comparing to the test error rate of 0.3385 by random forest on the same problem, XGBoost exhibits great improvement in performance.

![Confusion Matrix in Predicting Performance by XGBoost](graphs/xg_performance_confusionmatrix.png){#fig-XG_P_CM width=75%}

From the confusion matrix, we can see that the model is not just predicting less high performance (level 1) to improve performance. Although it is still biased towards low performance, it is a lot better than the random forest model as shown in @fig-RF_P_CM.

![ROC curve in Predicting Performance by XGBoost](graphs/xg_performance_ROC.png){#fig-XG_P_ROC width=75%}

Compared to the AUC of 0.74 by the random forest model, the XGBoost does not show much improvement with an AUC of 0.78.

## 5 Conclusion, Limitations, and Extensions
We used random forest and XGboost to predict the letter grade and the performance of students. When predicting letter grade, both random forest and XGboost consider total alchohol consumption to be one of the most important features in prediction. Their test error rate and AUC scores when predicting each grade are very similar to each other, indicating similar and moderately good model performance.

When predicting student performance, random forest consider total alchohol consumption to be the second most important feature while XGBoost only consider it to be the ninth important feature. XGBoost outperformed random forest significantly but their AUC scores are very similar. This indicates that the discriminative power of both models are similar, but differ in their calibration. Future research could try to finetune the random forest model to see if it can perform as good as XGBoost.

Overall, we can conclude that total alchohol consumption is one of the most important predictors of student letter grade and performance according to random forest and XGBoost.

For limitations, both models are biased towards the class with more observations (lower letter grade and low performance) and forcing them to balance the prediction would increase test error rate, which is probably the shared flaw of tree-based classification algorithms. Therefore, tree-based classification algorithms might not be the best technique when the dataset is unbalanced.

Also, we used random forest and XGBoost for classification, making it impossible to compare their performance with our linear regression model. Since random forest and XGBoost can also be applied in regression (although it is less common), future research can use the regression version of the two algorithms and compare their performance with that of linear regression.
